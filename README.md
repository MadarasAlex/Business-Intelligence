# Business-Intelligence
The project has been developed as part of the Data Science course at University of Twente, covering the topics of Data Processing and Data Visualization. 
It presents the analysis and visualizations of Classic Models Inc.'s business performance using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) approach to provide strategic recommendations for its management. 
The data is stored on a PostgreSQL DBMS server.

For this project we completed the following steps:

--

1. Design a Star (Snowflake) Schema

2. Formulate Business Questions for each of the four BSC perspectives: Financial, Customer, Internal Business Process, and Employee and Organization Innovation and Learning.

3. Prepare the data and upload it to the DBMS (with PostgreSQL).

4.Visualize the data.
